# where4dinner_ios_app
An app that helps customers better aware the wait time of local restaurants

Aims: The goal of this project is to increase transparency around local restaurant wait times and help customers make informed decisions about where to dine. To achieve this, the platform will allow restaurant staff and customers to input real-time information about the restaurant's current wait time, the number of people in line, and the availability of tables, etc. By enabling waiters, waitresses, and customers to contribute to this information-sharing system, we can provide a more accurate picture of the restaurant's busyness level, ultimately helping customers make better dining choices.
